# UFO Sightings with JavaScript

## Purpose 

Using JavaScript and HTML with Bootstrap, an interactive webpage was developed to allow users to view data on UFO sightings recorded during January of 2010.  The data is presented in a table and can be filtered based on 5 input fields.

## Results

## Summary

- Drawback of the Redesign:

The originial design of the webpage allowed users to filter by date only and contained a button to initalize the filter.  The new design removed the button.  

- Further Development:

1. Add a button to clear the fields after completing a search.  To clear the fields currently, the user must empty them manually or reload the page.
2. The alignment of the search fields with its corresponding label could be fixed with the label above the field or a fixed distance from the field to improve the aesthetic.
3. This is a small dataset but it does contain some typographical errors and lacks consistency in units, punctuation and capitialization.  Some cleaning may be in order.
